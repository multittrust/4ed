          You are invited to participate in our workshop, with or without a submission. To foster community building, we encourage submitting a short paper on your work—be it current,
          past, or future—related to the topics listed below. The 3rd Edition of MultiTTrust will be held at HHAI25 in Pisa, Italy, on the 9th June 2025.
        </p>
        <p>
          All submissions must adhere to CEUR-WS formatting guidelines (single-column). We will invite authors to archive these contributions at CEUR Workshop Proceedings (CEUR-WS.org)
          after the workshop, but there will be an opportunity to opt-out of this.
        </p>
        <p>
          Submissions should be written in English. Please anonymize your submissions. Submit your contributions through EasyChair.
