          <h3>Multi-Dimensional Trust: History, Evidence, and Applications to Individuals and Systems</h3>
          <h3><b>Abstract</b></h3>
          <p>
            There is much talk about trust in AI and robots; but it often seems unclear what trust really is, and how we should measure it. I briefly review some strands of work that led us to develop a multi-dimensional model and measure of trust that, we believe, integrates numerous previous approaches. I then show that ordinary people have a multi-dimensional conception of trust, whose primary dimensions are competence and reliability (together forming Performance trust), as well as ethical integrity, sincerity, and benevolence (together forming Moral trust). I introduce the MDMT, an intuitive measure of multi-dimensional trust, and present evidence for its validity and usefulness in studying trust in numerous targets, such as people, machines, animals, and institutions.
